# 🚀 Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) & Vulnerabilities

## 🎯 Tactics-Techniques-Procedures (TTPs)

TTPs define the **patterns of activities & methods** used by threat actors to execute cyber attacks.
They help analyze threats, profile attackers, and improve an organization's security infrastructure. 🔍

### 🔥 **Key Definitions**

- **Tactics 🎭** – The strategy followed by an attacker to conduct the attack from start to finish.
- **Techniques 🛠️** – The technical methods used to achieve intermediate results.
- **Procedures 📜** – The structured approach followed to execute an attack.

### 🛡️ **Why Understanding TTPs is Important?**

✅ Helps in predicting and detecting evolving threats 🚨
✅ Identifies vulnerabilities & improves defense mechanisms 🔒
✅ Analyzes attacker behavior to understand their objectives 🎯

---

## ⚠️ Opportunity-Vulnerability-Weakness

A **vulnerability** is a security flaw, design issue, or weakness that, when exploited, leads to security compromise. 🚨

### 🔥 **Common Types of Vulnerabilities**

### 1️⃣ **TCP/IP Protocol Vulnerabilities 🌐**

🔴 Hosts depend **only on IP source address** for authentication ❌
🔴 **Lack of authentication** in network control mechanisms 🔍
🔴 Examples: **SYN attack, Ping Flooding, IP Spoofing** 🚨

### 2️⃣ **Operating System Vulnerabilities 🖥️**

🔴 Outdated or insecure OS exposes critical flaws ⚠️
🔴 Common vulnerabilities: **Memory corruption, Overflow, DoS, CSRF, Remote Code Execution** 💻

### 3️⃣ **Network Device Vulnerabilities 🔗**

🔴 **Weak password protection** 🔑
🔴 **Lack of authentication in routers/firewalls** 🏴‍☠️
🔴 **Insecure routing protocols & firewall misconfigurations** 🔥
