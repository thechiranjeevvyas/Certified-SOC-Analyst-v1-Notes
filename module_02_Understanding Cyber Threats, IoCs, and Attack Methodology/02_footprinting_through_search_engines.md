# Section 02:Intent, Motive, Goal & TTPs

## 🎯 Intent, Motive, Goal & TTPs - Last Minute Notes

### 🔥 Intent, Motive & Goal

Attackers have **motives** behind cyber attacks, which drive their **goals** and **objectives**. These motives arise from the idea that a system holds something valuable, leading to **threats and attacks**.

#### 🛠️ **Attack Formula:**

🔹 **Attack = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability**

#### 🏴‍☠️ **Common Motives Behind Cyber Attacks**

* 🚨 Disrupting business continuity
* 🔓 Stealing sensitive information
* 🔄 Manipulating or altering data
* ⚠️ Creating fear by targeting critical infrastructure
* 💰 Causing financial loss
* ✝️📜 Propagating religious or political beliefs
* 🏹 Achieving military objectives
* 🏢 Tarnishing an organization’s reputation
* 🔥 Seeking revenge
* 🏴 Demanding ransom (Ransomware attacks)

### ⚔️ Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)

TTPs refer to **patterns of activities and methods** used by threat actors. Understanding these helps in analyzing threats and improving security.

#### 📌 **TTP Breakdown:**

1. 🏹 **Tactics:** Strategy used by an attacker from start to finish.
2. 🛠️ **Techniques:** Technical methods used to achieve specific attack stages.
3. 📜 **Procedures:** Structured approach used by attackers to execute attacks.

#### 🔎 **Why Understanding TTPs Matters?**

* 🎯 Helps **predict & detect** evolving threats early.
* 🔄 Identifies vulnerabilities and enables proactive defenses.
* 🏰 Improves security against known adversary behaviors.

### 🚪 Opportunity, Vulnerability & Weakness

A **vulnerability** is a security loophole that allows attackers to bypass protections and infiltrate systems. If left unpatched, it can lead to various attacks.

#### ⚡ **Common Types of Vulnerabilities**

**🌐 TCP/IP Protocol Vulnerabilities**

* Overlapping IP Fragments 🧩
* SYN Attack 💥
* Ping Flooding 🌊
* IP Spoofing 🎭

**💻 Operating System Vulnerabilities**

* 📌 Memory corruption & overflow
* 🖥️ Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* 🚨 Denial of Service (DoS)
* ⚠️ CSRF & File Inclusion Exploits

**🔌 Network Device Vulnerabilities**

* ❌ Weak password protection
* 🔓 Lack of authentication
* 🌍 Insecure routing protocols
* 🔥 Firewall misconfigurations
