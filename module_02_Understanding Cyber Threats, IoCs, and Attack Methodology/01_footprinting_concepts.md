# Section 01: Cyber Threats

## ☁️ Cyber Threats - Last Minute Notes ⚡

### 🔥 What Are Cyber Threats?

Cyber threats are malicious activities that target individuals, organizations, and systems to steal, damage, or disrupt data and operations.

***

### ☁️ **Cloud Computing Threats** 🌩️

Cloud services are vulnerable to:

* **Data Breaches** 🔓 - Unauthorized access to sensitive cloud data.
* **Account Hijacking** 🔑 - Attackers gain control over user accounts.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks** 🚫 - Overloading cloud resources to disrupt services.
* **Misconfigured Security Settings** ⚙️ - Leaving cloud data exposed due to poor settings.

***

### 🦠 **Viruses & Worms** 🕵️‍♂️

Malicious software that spreads and causes system damage.

* **Viruses** ❌ - Need a host file to execute and spread.
* **Worms** 🏃 - Spread autonomously across networks without user intervention.

***

### 💰 **Ransomware** 🔒

Malware that encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption.

* **Example:** WannaCry 🦠, Locky 🔐
* **Prevention:** Regular backups, patch updates, and strong security policies.

***

### 📱 **Mobile Threats** 📡

Smartphones and tablets face various security risks:

* **Malware & Spyware** 🕵️ - Infect devices and steal data.
* **App Vulnerabilities** 📲 - Insecure apps can expose personal information.
* **Public Wi-Fi Attacks** 📡 - Hackers intercept data on open networks.

***

### 🤖 **Botnets** 🛜

Networks of infected computers controlled remotely to perform cyber attacks.

* Used for **DDoS attacks** 🔥, spam emails ✉️, and credential theft 🔑.
* **Prevention:** Use strong passwords, enable firewalls, and update software regularly.

***

### 🏢 **Insider Threats** 👥

Employees or contractors misusing their access for malicious purposes.

* **Types:**
  * **Malicious Insider** 😈 - Intentionally leaks or damages data.
  * **Negligent Insider** ⚠️ - Unknowingly exposes sensitive information.
* **Mitigation:** Strict access controls, employee monitoring, security training.

***

### 🎣 **Phishing** 📧

Fraudulent emails or messages tricking users into revealing credentials.

* **Types:**
  * **Spear Phishing** 🎯 - Targeted attack on specific individuals.
  * **Whaling** 🐋 - Targets high-profile executives.
* **Defense:** Email filtering, security awareness training, and multi-factor authentication.

***

### 🌐 **Web Application Threats** 🔓

* **SQL Injection** 💉 - Attackers manipulate database queries.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** 🚀 - Injects malicious scripts into web pages.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** 🔄 - Forces users to perform unwanted actions.

***

### 🔌 **IoT Threats** 📶

Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack security, making them easy targets.

* **Insecure Firmware** 🛠️ - Unpatched vulnerabilities allow attacks.
* **Default Credentials** 🗝️ - Weak passwords make hacking easy.
* **DDoS Attacks** 🔥 - IoT devices are hijacked for massive cyber attacks.

***

🎯 **Stay Secure:** Regular updates, strong authentication, encryption, and user awareness training! 🔐🚀
