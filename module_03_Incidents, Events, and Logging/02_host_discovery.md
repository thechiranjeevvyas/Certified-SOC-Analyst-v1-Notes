## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.
