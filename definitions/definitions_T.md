## The Dark Web
The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets: overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.
Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location.

## TheHarvester
TheHarvester is a simple to use, yet powerful tool designed to be used during the reconnaissance stage of a red team assessment or penetration test.
It performs open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine a domain's external threat landscape.
The tool gathers names, emails, IPs, subdomains, and URLs by using multiple public resources that include:

## Threat Modelling
Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized.

## Top Level Domain
A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet after the root domain.

## Tor
Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication.
It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than seven thousand relays, to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis.

## Traceroute
In computing, traceroute and tracert are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying possible routes (paths) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection.

Tcptraceroute
> Tcptraceroute performs the same task as traceroute, but it uses the TCP protocol instead of ICMP for tracing the route to the destination.

## Transmission Control Protocol
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).

TCP segment flags 
- SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers. Only the first packet sent from each end should have this flag set. Some other flags and fields change meaning based on this flag, and some are only valid when it is set, and others when it is clear.
- ACK: Indicates that the Acknowledgment field is significant. All packets after the initial SYN packet sent by the client should have this flag set.
- FIN: Last packet from sender
- RST: Reset the connection
 
TCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent.
The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established.
Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency.

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) is an essential concept in terrorism and cyber security studies.
The role of TTPs in terrorism analysis is to identify individual patterns of behavior of a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation, and to examine and categorize more general tactics and weapons used by a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation.
