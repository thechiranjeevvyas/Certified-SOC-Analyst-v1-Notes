## Media Access Control Address Spoofing
MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.
The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed.
However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.
