## Security Management

The security management system is a collection of a systematic, repetitive set of interconnected security activities that help organizations to maintain their security posture at an adequate level. It is an ongoing effort that focuses on both physical safety and digital security of assets

## Security Activities Involved in Security Management

Broadly, security management comprises different security activities:

- Security Infrastructure :
  It provides security to Perimeter, Network, Endpoint, and Application & Data by implementing adequate preventive, detective, and corrective information security controls.
- Security Prevention
  Security prevention services like vulnerability management and penetration testing ensure security in the networks against vulnerabilities and threats. These services not only scan, test, and identify threats across internal or external networks but also remediate or reduce their exposure.
- Compliance and Validation
  Various governance risk and compliance programs help the organization to continue its business without any risks. Some of the examples of governance risk and compliance programs involve ISO 27001 Readiness Assessment, Security Baseline policy document for ISMS, and so on.
- Security Operations
  These operations are performed by the Security Operation Center (SOC) through real-time security alerting, threat analysis & intelligence, correlation, and preemptive incident reporting, detection, and response.

### Security Operations

Security operation is the continuous operational practice for maintaining and managing a secure IT environment through the implementation and execution of certain services and processes. Its main purpose is to prevent, detect, prioritize, and respond to security incidents.

### Security operation may consist of various security operation tasks, which include:

- Security Monitoring
  It involves collecting and analyzing information to identify abnormal behavior and unusual activities in the network. Also, escalating malicious activities to incident response system for resolution.
- Security Incident Management :
  It includes detecting, managing, and monitoring security vulnerabilities in real-time with minimal adverse impact.
- Vulnerability Management :
  It is a cyclical process that includes continuous monitoring, triage, and mitigation of system vulnerabilities. It is an integral part of computer security and network security.
- Security Device Management :
  It involves maintaining and managing security infrastructure and devices, as well as updating software in the organization. It helps in securing an organization's assets and maintaining a compliance requirement for regulations.
- Network-flow Monitoring :
  It detects and analyzes inflow and outflow of packets in the network and generates alerts whenever suspicious activities arise
