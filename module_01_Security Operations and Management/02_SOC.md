# Section 02: Security Operations Center (SOC)

## Overview

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit responsible for continuously monitoring, managing, and analyzing an organization's security infrastructure. It safeguards networks, servers, endpoints, databases, applications, and websites by detecting, preventing, and responding to threats in real time.

SOC is also known as:

- Security Defense Center (SDC)
- Security Analytics Center (SAC)
- Cyber Security Center
- Network Security Operations Center (NSOC)
- Threat Defense Center
- Security Intelligence and Operations Center (SIOC)

By aggregating data from logs, IDS/IPS, firewalls, and network flows, SOC enhances situational awareness and facilitates rapid incident response.

## Need for SOC

Traditional security measures (firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus, email filtering, etc.) are no longer sufficient as cyber threats evolve. SOC addresses these gaps by continuously updating security protocols and responding to emerging vulnerabilities.

### Key Responsibilities of SOC:

- **Threat Detection & Analysis**: Identifies suspicious activities within networks and systems.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Assesses system weaknesses and mitigates potential risks.
- **Asset Awareness**: Maintains an inventory of all hardware and software assets.
- **Log Management**: Facilitates forensic analysis during security breaches.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Ensures compliance with security policies and procedures.
- **Internal Controls Assessment**: Verifies internal controls for service reliability.
- **Incident Response**: Responds swiftly to cyber threats and minimizes business losses.
- **Security Strengthening**: Enhances organizational security posture.
- **Blind Spot Elimination**: Identifies and eradicates internal security gaps.
- **Legacy Device Management**: Handles outdated and unsupported devices securely.
- **Data Protection**: Monitors and secures large volumes of sensitive data.
- **User Privilege Monitoring**: Detects and mitigates privileged user abuse.
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Ensures continuous surveillance for threat detection.
- **Security Tool Customization**: Implements and adapts security tools to fit organizational needs.
- **Resource Optimization**: Enhances control over staffing and security operations.

By leveraging SOC, organizations can improve security resilience, minimize risks, and ensure business continuity.

## 3.2 SOC Capabilities

SOC's core capabilities revolve around **preventing, detecting, responding to, and reporting security incidents**.

### **Preventive Capability**

- Stops attacks before they succeed.
- Uses fine-tuning and maintenance tools.
- Guides the Incident Response Team in security monitoring.
- Utilizes detection rules and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to identify risks.

### **Detection Capability**

- Monitors systems and networks for suspicious activities.
- Collects, analyzes, and correlates security events.
- Triggers alerts when security breaches occur.
- Notifies clients about security issues.

### **Response Capability**

- Analyzes and addresses security alerts and incidents promptly.

### **Reporting Capability**

- Provides security reports on asset protection, compliance levels, and alarms.
- Uses dashboards to display service, technical, and trend indicators.

### **Forensics**

- Uses structured log data to investigate attack patterns.
- Restricts attackers from launching further attacks.
- Supports audit and compliance by efficiently retrieving stored logs.

## 3.3 SOC Operations

### **Typical Functions of SOC:**

#### **Log Collection**

- Aggregates logs from security systems and transactional activities.
- Collects logs via syslog or centralized log management.

#### **Log Retention and Archival**

- Centrally stores logs for forensic analysis and compliance.
- Helps identify attack patterns and deviations in system behavior.

#### **Log Analysis**

- Cleans, structures, and analyzes log data to detect anomalies.
- Extracts security-relevant metrics from raw data.
- Aids in security breach investigation and response.

#### **Monitoring of Security Environments for Security Events**

- Transfers analyzed log data to SOC teams for real-time security assessment.

#### **Event Correlation**

- Correlates security events automatically from multiple sources.
- Uses predefined correlation rules to reduce false positives.

#### **Incident Management**

- Handles reported security incidents efficiently.
- Prioritizes incidents based on predefined rules.

#### **Threat Identification**

- Uses threat intelligence and behavior analytics to identify vulnerabilities.

#### **Threat Reaction and Response**

- Reacts proactively or reactively to threats.
- Identifies weaknesses in infrastructure before attackers exploit them.

#### **Reporting**

- Generates detailed security reports for real-time and audit purposes.
- Reports include malicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, DoS attacks, and suspicious emails.

### **Secondary SOC Operations:**

#### **Malware Analysis**

- Analyzes viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, and backdoors.
- Develops detection techniques based on malware behavior.

#### **Vulnerability Management**

- Identifies, classifies, and mitigates vulnerabilities using automated and manual testing.

### **SOC Workflow:**

1. **Collection** – Security logs are collected and forwarded to the SIEM.
2. **Ingestion** – SIEM processes log data, threat intelligence, and indicators of compromise.
3. **Validation** – SOC analysts identify IoCs, triage alerts, and validate incidents.
4. **Reporting** – Validated incidents are submitted to the incident response team.
5. **Response** – The SOC team executes incident response activities.
6. **Documentation** – Incidents are documented for audits and future reference.
