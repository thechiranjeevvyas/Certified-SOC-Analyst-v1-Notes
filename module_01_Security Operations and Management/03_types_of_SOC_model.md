# Section 03: Types Of SOC Model

## Types of SOC Models

Organizations implement SOC (Security Operations Center) models to monitor and manage security threats. The choice of SOC model depends on the organization's size, budget, past security incidents, and operational requirements. Here are the three main types of SOC models:

***

### 🌟 In-House/Internal SOC Model 🏢

This model is best for organizations concerned with outsourcing security risks and maintaining data integrity. It requires a dedicated team for 24/7 security monitoring.

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* Deep understanding of the organization's security environment.
* Enhanced control over security data.
* Customizable security solutions.
* Fast communication during security incidents.

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* High setup and maintenance costs.
* Difficulty in hiring skilled security analysts.
* Coordination challenges within teams.

***

### 🌍 Outsourced SOC Model 🌐

A **Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)** handles security operations, reducing startup costs and leveraging expertise from multiple clients.

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* Cost-effective compared to in-house SOC.
* Faster implementation with expert security teams.
* Scalable and flexible services.
* Meets compliance requirements.

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* Risk of external data mishandling.
* Lack of deep knowledge about the organization's environment.
* Limited customization options.

***

### 🔄 Hybrid SOC Model ⚡

A combination of **in-house** and **outsourced** SOC, balancing cost, expertise, and operational efficiency.

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* Best of both worlds: internal team’s knowledge + MSSP’s expertise.
* Improved threat intelligence.
* Lower operational costs compared to a fully in-house SOC.

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* Requires additional hardware and vendor coordination.
* More expensive than other models.
* Coordination between internal and external teams is crucial.

## 🏆 SOC Maturity Models

SOC **maturity models** help organizations assess their cybersecurity capabilities and measure their effectiveness.

#### 🔹 **Maturity Levels**

1. **Level 1:** Create correlation rules 🔍
2. **Level 2:** Automate responses ⚡
3. **Level 3:** Service management integration 🔄

### 🏅 SOC-Capability Maturity Model (SOC-CMM)

A structured framework that evaluates SOC capabilities:

* **Level 0:** Non-existent ❌
* **Level 1:** Initial 🟡
* **Level 2:** Defined 🟢
* **Level 3:** Managed 🔵
* **Level 4:** Quantitatively Managed 🟣
* **Level 5:** Optimized 🔥

### 📊 Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT)

Developed by ISACA, COBIT is a governance framework ensuring IT security and business risk alignment.

#### ✨ Key Components

* **Framework:** Industry best practices.
* **Process Descriptions:** Defines IT governance.
* **Control Objectives:** Ensures business security.
* **Maturity Models:** Assesses IT maturity.
* **Management Guidelines:** Assigns roles and responsibilities.

### 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Developed by **NIST**, this framework strengthens cybersecurity by providing risk management guidelines.

#### 🔥 **Benefits of NIST**

* Identifies and mitigates cybersecurity risks.
* Ensures compliance with security regulations.
* Helps organizations prioritize security investments.
* Establishes trustworthiness in securing critical assets.
